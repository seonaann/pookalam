# ✨Code-A-Pookalam✨


## Basic Details
### Name: Interactive Animated Pookalam

### Project Description
This project is a Python-based application that generates and displays a beautiful, animated Pookalam (a traditional Indian flower arrangement). The program runs interactively in the terminal, allowing the user to change the color and pattern of the outer layer in real-time while the animation is running.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
- Languages used: Python
- Frameworks used: None
- Libraries used:matplotlib, numpy, threading, queue
- Tools used: Git / GitHub for version control.

# Installation
pip install matplotlib numpy

# Run
Save the code as a Python file (e.g., interactive_animated_pookalam.py).

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where you saved the file

python interactive_animated_pookalam.py

# Screenshots (Add at least 3)

The program starts and immediately prints a welcome message, along with a list of available commands.

You can see the user (you) typing commands like color_outer red,yellow,orange and pattern_outer squares.

The program successfully receives, processes, and responds to these commands in real-time (Outer colors changed to: ...).

The Pookalam animation in the separate window (not shown in the screenshot) would change its appearance instantly with each command you entered, without ever having to be stopped and restarted.
